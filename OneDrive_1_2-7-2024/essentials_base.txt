Creating a comprehensive set of templates for migrating a Microsoft application stack to Azure, with a focus on best security practices, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), high availability, scalability, threat protection, Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations, and multi-billion enterprise considerations is a complex process. Below is a high-level step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### Step 1: Define Requirements and Scope

1. **Gather Requirements:**
   - Engage with stakeholders to define functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Identify specific security and compliance requirements.

2. **Scope the Migration:**
   - Clearly define the scope of the migration, including the list of applications, data, and dependencies.

### Step 2: Azure Resource Planning

3. **Azure Subscription:**
   - Ensure you have an Azure subscription that aligns with enterprise requirements.

4. **Azure Architecture Planning:**
   - Design the Azure architecture, considering virtual networks, subnets, and Azure regions.

5. **Resource Group Structure:**
   - Plan how to organize resources into Azure resource groups for manageability.

### Step 3: Security and Compliance

6. **Azure Security Center:**
   - Enable Azure Security Center to gain insights into security posture and to implement security best practices.

7. **Azure Policy and Blueprints:**
   - Define Azure Policies and Blueprints to enforce compliance and governance standards.

8. **Key Vault:**
   - Use Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage sensitive information like secrets, keys, and certificates.

### Step 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

9. **Choose IaC Tool:**
   - Select an IaC tool such as Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Terraform, or Bicep.

10. **Create ARM Templates:**
    - Develop ARM templates to define and deploy Azure resources. Organize templates based on resource types.

### Step 5: High Availability and Scalability

11. **Availability Zones:**
    - Leverage Azure Availability Zones for high availability and redundancy.

12. **Scaling Strategies:**
    - Implement auto-scaling for applications that require dynamic scalability.

13. **Load Balancing:**
    - Use Azure Load Balancers or Application Gateways for distributing traffic.

### Step 6: Threat Protection

14. **Azure Advanced Threat Protection:**
    - Implement Azure Advanced Threat Protection for threat intelligence and detection.

15. **DDoS Protection:**
    - Configure Azure DDoS Protection Standard for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation.

### Step 7: Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

16. **Azure Active Directory (AAD):**
    - Integrate with Azure Active Directory for identity management and Single Sign-On.

17. **Azure AD B2B/B2C:**
    - If needed, implement Azure AD Business-to-Business (B2B) or Business-to-Consumer (B2C) for external user access.

### Step 8: Multi-Billion Enterprise Considerations

18. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Set up Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for centralized monitoring and logging.

19. **Azure Policy and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    - Enforce policies and RBAC to control access and manage resources at scale.

20. **Enterprise Networking:**
    - Consider using Azure Virtual WAN or ExpressRoute for secure and performant connectivity.

### Step 9: Testing and Validation

21. **Non-Production Environment:**
    - Deploy the configuration to a non-production environment for thorough testing.

22. **Security Testing:**
    - Perform security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.

### Step 10: Deployment to Production

23. **Gradual Deployment:**
    - Roll out changes gradually to production, considering rollback plans.

24. **Continuous Monitoring:**
    - Set up continuous monitoring and alerting to detect issues promptly.

### Step 11: Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

25. **Documentation:**
    - Document the deployment architecture, configurations, and procedures.

26. **Knowledge Transfer:**
    - Share knowledge with the operations and support teams for ongoing maintenance.

### Step 12: Ongoing Optimization and Governance

27. **Cost Management:**
    - Implement Azure Cost Management to monitor and optimize costs.

28. **Governance and Compliance:**
    - Periodically review and update governance policies to ensure ongoing compliance.

### Conclusion:

Migrating a multi-billion enterprise application stack to Azure requires a systematic and careful approach. This guide provides a framework for creating templates and configurations, but the details will vary based on the specific applications and enterprise requirements. Always stay updated with Azure best practices and security guidelines. Consider engaging with Azure experts or consultants for complex enterprise scenarios.
